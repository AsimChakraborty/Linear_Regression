# Linear_Regression
Linear means straight line. If we want to solve any problem with a line model, it will be a linear model. Linear regression is the method of predicting real value of a dependent variable based on independent variables. It represents with a straight line.
y=mx+c 

#
y=means dependent variables , m=means Coefficient/slope of the line ,x=means independent variables, c=means intercept

#Multiple Linear Regression
#
Multiple linear regression refers a linear relationship between a single output with multiple input.
#
#Formula for multiple linear regression
Y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ..... + βpxp

#Decision Tree
#
Decision tree is a type of classification algorithm which comes under the supervised learning technique.
Decision trees usually start from a single node and then branch into possible outcomes. Each of these results leads to other nodes, which branch into other possibilities. This gives it a tree-like shape. Decision trees are used for handling non-linear data sets effectively.
Decision trees can be divided into two types; categorical variable and continuous variable decision trees
#
#Entropy
#
Entropy measures the impurity or uncertainty present in the data. It is used to decide how a Decision Tree can split the data.

#Information Gain 
#
Information Gain (IG) is the most significant measure used to build a Decision Tree.
